jenkins
=======

We run a Jenkins build box Mac Mini to generate our OS X builds.

The server needs to be tunnelled to a proxy. To enable this, the
contents of LaunchAgents to be placed at `~/Library/LaunchAgents`
```
cp -r ./LaunchAgents/* ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
```
These ensure that:

1. An SSH-tunnel connects our bot to the internet through a proxy
2. An SSH-tunnel connects our bot to the jenkins-cli through a proxy

The SSH tunnels are aggressively maintained - if SSH dies, they will 
restart, and they ping the proxy server every 3 seconds.

# Updating

To update, download the latest `jenkins.war` file (the link in the settings is probably the easiest).
You'll want to SSH to jenkins to download the file so you can move it:
```
> wget link/to/jenkins.war
> sudo mv jenkins.war /Applications/Jenkins/jenkins.war
```
Once the war has been replaced, sign into jenkins.menpo.org with admin credentials, then manually hit
```
http://jenkins.menpo.org/safeRestart
```
in your browser. Accept the prompt, and wait for jenkins to come back up.

Be sure to periodically visit the plugins page too, and download updates for all our plugins.


TEMPLATES
---------

When you need to change jenkins settings, we edit the two templates we have
(`TEMPLATE` and `TEMPLATE-pr`) and then use the scripts here to update
all projects.

Note that the naming scheme here is relied upon by condaci (see https://github.com/menpo/condaci/pull/11) so **do not change the naming scheme (.e.g `project-pr` `project`)**.
